# JsAutoTesting
This simple project allows you to create automated crawling tests to see if your site is reachable and working properly.
Right now it has a rails api to crawl websites (pretty basic) and a frontend in basic html/js.

### Further developments
Things I want to work on:

- API hooks
- CLI API
- Some simple library for some language
